            <h3>Mocha</h3>
            <p><strong>Mocha is the youngest and latest addition to the family. She is very friendly and loving to most people, but does have a tendency to play very aggressively. Shes a little troublemaker sometimes, but we love her for it!</strong></p>

            <h3><strong>Kitty</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Kitty is the middle child and does she ever have an interesting personality. Shes can be quite goofy sometimes and will often be shy and a bit of a scaredy cat. Although not the sharpest tool in the shed, she is super cute and fluffy and she loves chasing a laser pointer around!</strong></p>

            <h3><strong>Shadow</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Shadow is the oldest (almost 15!) of the three, but she is the absolute princess. Very smart and athletic cat, she enjoys playing but more than anything she loves to lay down next to you and have her belly scratched. Absolutey sweetheart and the most chill cat you have ever met.</strong></p>
